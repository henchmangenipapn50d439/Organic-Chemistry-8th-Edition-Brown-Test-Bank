  * Master course concepts and improve problem-solving skills with ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 8th Edition. This student-friendly text focuses on "how to" skills, and includes examples, problems, and end-of-chapter comprehensive study guides to help you prepare for exams. To help you understand reaction mechanisms, the authors offset them in a stepwise fashion and emphasize similarities between related mechanisms using just four different characteristics: breaking a bond, making a new bond, adding a proton, and taking a proton away. Thoroughly updated, the book offers numerous biological examples for premed students, unique roadmap problems, a wide range of in-text learning tools, and new author-created videos to help you excel.
